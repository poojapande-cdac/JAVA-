//Assignment 2 Inheritance. 


// create interface "Game" , have an abstract method "play()". from this interface implements classes like "Cricket" , "FootBall" and "Tennis".
Now Define one more class 
public class Demo with main function.
In this class have a static method "perform" which will take interface reference as parameter.inside "perform()" see to it that any child object passed ,its "play()" method should be invoked. Call "perform()" method from main function.
